        <li>2 medium carrots, peeled and finely diced</li>
        <lI>1 cup broccoli florets (cut into 3/4-inch pieces)</lI>
        <li>1 cup asparagus tips</li>
        <li>1/2 cup fresh or frozen peas</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>Salt and heavy ground pepper</li>
        <li>10 basil leaves, stacked and cut into thin ribbons</li>
        <li>1 pound fresh fettuccine</li>
        <li>3/4 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <strong>Steps</strong>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring at least 4 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot. Add salt to taste. Add the broccoli and
            asparagus and cook for 1 minute. 
            <br> With a small sieve, scoop out the vegetables and drain them
            well. Leave the water boiling in the pot</li>
        <lI>In a skillet large enough to hold the cooked fettuccine, melt the butter over medium heat. Add
            the onion and carrots and cook, 
            <br>stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes, or until softened.</lI>
        <li>Add the broccoli and asparagus to the skillet, along with the peas and cream. Bring to a
            simmer. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Stir in the basil and turn off the heat.</li>
        <li>Drop the fettuccine into the boiling water and cook, stirring frequently, until al dente, tender
            yet still firm to the bite. 
            <br>Drain the fettuccine and add it to the skillet. Add the cheese and toss
            well. Serve immediately.</li>    
    </ol>
